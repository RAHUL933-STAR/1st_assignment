    "# Ridge Regularization:\n",
    "# Ridge regularization adds the squared sum of the coefficients to the loss function. It discourages the coefficients from becoming too large, leading to a model \n",
    "# that is more robust to multicollinearity and less likely to overfit. The regularization parameter (λ) controls the strength of the regularization. In your case,\n",
    "# Model A uses Ridge regularization with a λ of 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lasso Regularization:\n",
    "# Lasso regularization, on the other hand, adds the absolute sum of the coefficients to the loss function. It has a feature selection property where it can drive some \n",
    "# coefficients to exactly zero, effectively excluding less important features from the model. This can result in a more interpretable and sparse model. \n",
    "# The regularization parameter (λ) also controls the strength of the regularization. In your case, Model B uses Lasso regularization with a λ of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Choosing the Better Performer:\n",
    "# To determine which model is the better performer, you would typically use cross-validation or a separate validation dataset to evaluate their performance on unseen data. \n",
    "# Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) can be used to compare the predictive accuracy of the two models on the validation data. The model \n",
    "# with lower error values on the validation data would be considered the better performer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trade-offs and Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Selection: Lasso's feature selection property can be both an advantage and a limitation. While it can help in identifying and excluding irrelevant features,\n",
    "# it might also exclude features that are actually relevant but have smaller coefficients. Ridge, being less aggressive in driving coefficients to exactly zero, might \n",
    "# maintain more of these relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interpretability: Ridge regularization doesn't force coefficients to zero, making it potentially easier to interpret as all features remain in the model. Lasso's \n",
    "# feature selection can lead to a more sparse model but might complicate the interpretation due to excluded features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Sensitivity: Lasso is more sensitive to outliers compared to Ridge. Outliers can disproportionately affect the coefficient estimates in Lasso, which might\n",
    "# lead to suboptimal results if the dataset contains significant outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity: Lasso regularization can lead to a more complex optimization problem due to its non-smooth nature at the origin. Ridge regularization, on the other hand, \n",
    "# has a smooth and convex solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuning Regularization Parameters: The choice of the regularization parameter (λ) is crucial in both Ridge and Lasso. It requires tuning, often using techniques like \n",
    "# cross-validation. The performance of the models can be sensitive to the specific choice of λ."
