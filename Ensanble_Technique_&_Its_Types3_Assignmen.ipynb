    "#Ensemble of Decision Trees: The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. This ensemble approach is one\n",
    "#of the primary ways it reduces overfitting. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a different bootstrap sample of the training data, created by random sampling with replacement. As a result, each tree \n",
    "#sees a slightly different subset of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Because the trees are trained on different data subsets, they are likely to capture different aspects of the underlying data distribution and make different errors. \n",
    "#This diversity among the trees helps to reduce the overall variance of the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Random Feature Selection: In addition to bootstrapping, the Random Forest Regressor introduces another layer of randomness by considering only a random subset of features \n",
    "#(attributes) at each split node of each decision tree. This feature selection mechanism further promotes diversity among the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Randomly selecting features at each node ensures that no single feature dominates the splitting decisions in the majority of trees. This prevents the model from \n",
    "#overemphasizing any particular feature or attribute, which can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "#Averaging Predictions: When making predictions, each individual decision tree in the Random Forest Regressor independently produces a prediction based on the input data. \n",
    "#The final prediction for the ensemble is typically obtained by averaging the predictions of all the decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Averaging the predictions of multiple trees smooths out the noise and errors present in individual tree predictions. It helps to ensure that the ensemble's predictions \n",
    "#are more robust and less susceptible to outliers or idiosyncrasies in the training data.\n",
    "#Limiting Tree Depth: Random Forest Regressor often imposes a limit on the maximum depth of each decision tree in the ensemble. By limiting tree depth, the model prevents \n",
    "#individual trees from growing too complex and fitting the training data too closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Shallow trees are less likely to overfit because they have a limited capacity to capture fine-grained noise in the data. This constraint encourages the model to \n",
    "#capture more general and meaningful patterns."
