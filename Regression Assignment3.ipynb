    "# The model aims to find linear coefficients that best represent this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Independence: The observations (data points) used for training the Ridge Regression model should be independent of each other. This assumption helps ensure that the \n",
    "# errors or residuals are not correlated and that the model can accurately capture the underlying relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Homoscedasticity: Ridge Regression assumes that the variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread\n",
    "# of the residuals should be roughly the same for all predicted values. The introduction of the regularization term in Ridge doesn't directly affect this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Normality of Residuals: Ridge Regression, like OLS, assumes that the residuals (differences between predicted and actual values) follow a normal distribution. However, \n",

    "\n",
    "# Grid search is conceptually simple and can be effective, but it may require a significant amount of computational resources when searching over a large range of λ values.\n",
