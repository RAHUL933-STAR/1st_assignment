    "# Mean: Outliers can greatly influence the mean. Since the mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of values, \n",
    "#       even a single outlier with a substantially large or small value can pull the mean towards it. This effect is particularly \n",
    "#       prominent when the dataset is relatively small.\n",
    "# Median: The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean. It represents the middle value of a dataset when arranged in ascending or \n",
    "#         descending order. Outliers have minimal influence on the median unless they are extreme and affect the order of the dataset.\n",
