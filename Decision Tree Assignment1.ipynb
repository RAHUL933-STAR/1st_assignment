    "# The recursive splitting process continues until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion could be a maximum depth for the tree, a minimum number of samples required\n",

    "# Leaf Nodes: Eventually, the algorithm stops splitting and creates leaf nodes. Each leaf node represents a region of the feature space where the majority class (0 or 1) \n",

    "# algorithm learned that people under 30 with higher incomes are more likely to make a purchase, while those over 30 might need even higher incomes to be likely purchasers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluating the Model:\n",
    "# To assess the model's performance, you can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset. Additionally, you can use techniques \n",
    "# like cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability."
